**The real question you should be asking yourself is, what does it mean to be a full-stack developer?**

Ballparking the amount of hours it will take to get to that place is something important to ask yourself, but it's also partially missing the point. If you really want to pursue that mastery, something around 1,000 hours is really the beginning of that stage in your life.

Technology changes constantly, as do the languages and databases you will use in your everyday work. You have to welcome change. That means a desire to improve, to learn, and to admit that learning is part of the job.

All that said, this can be broken into multiple components: Time (you'll have to commit a lot of it to get at an entry professional level), subject matter (though it's mostly about learning how to learn more than anything else), and the bigger picture (everything you do that rounds out the skills you are trying to learn).

With that in mind, here are the top three things to consider if you want to become a full-stack developer:

TIME
Measured in both hours, days, and months, depending on when you can spend the time:

Months:
3-4
60 hours a week, at about 10 hours/6 days a week

4-5
40 hours a week, at about 8 hours/5 days a week

7-10
20 hours a week, at about 4 hours/5 days a week

If someone tells you that you can become a full stack developer within two months, be skeptical. It’s more than just learning different lines of code, or how to making something pretty. It’s also learning how to apply what you’ve learned to both a theoretical and practical framework. That’s why the other essential element to this is how you spend those hours.

**SUBJECT MATTER**
Full stack is just that — the whole package. Both front-end and back-end development entail learning several different languages and use of the programs that unite them into those beautiful websites you peruse everyday.

Here’s another breakdown of the type of content that will help you get to where you want to be:

HTML: The world’s most fundamental programming language, found on every website in existence.
CSS: The stylesheet language that makes those websites so great looking and stylized.
Ruby: A dynamic, open-sourced language that is both simple and powerful in its usage
SQL: Designed to manage data and stream process data into a management system
Postgres: Another open-source data management system
Sinatra: An open-source, web application library for app frameworks
Rails: Another web app for frameworks
JavaScript: A high-level language that programs the behavior of webpages

The beauty of learning these types of languages and programs is also that it will teach you to think in the way a professional developer does. Some, of course, are non-negotiable (like HTML). But if you decide to go with Python instead of Ruby, for example, you’ll still be learning how to use a back-end language — and that will always be a valuable use of your time.

**THE BIGGER PICTURE**
Here’s another question to assess when you’re approaching this: how are you learning? Are you going it alone, are you looking at an in-person immersive, or are you taking an online immersive? That will determine what those hours mean as well, and it’s important that if you’re doing either #1 or #3, that you find an online community for support to help you through. Not just for information, either, but to prevent burnout and give you purpose with the code you’re writing.

No matter which learning path you’re taking, here are a few concrete pieces of advice if you’re looking to be employable by the end of this as well:

1. **Start with a transparent work history from day one**
If you’re practicing programming on random websites, none of that hard work will be documented, and you won’t be able to use it for your portfolio later on! Be sure to choose a program that allows you to document your work history on GitHub — it will boost your legitimacy and leave robust practice for employers to see what you’ve been working hard on. Learn’s full stack program does a good job of integrating that feature.

**2. Find a community for support.**
If you’ve decided to attend an in-person immersive, this won’t be that hard. However, if you’re learning online or alone, it’s especially important for you to find people to share your experience with. This is for several reasons: it’s not just good for morale, but it will help boost your general knowledge, and even give you potential job connections later on. Never underestimate the power of a community! Maybe that community is built into the online platform you’re using. If not, try to find some interactive forums, Slack chats, or threads that help give you the community that makes code real and effective.

**3. Blog about your experience.**
This actually goes pretty hand-in-hand with the transparent work history. Employers love to see that you’re actively engaged in your work and that you’re constantly learning. A blog is not only a great way to showcase what you’re working on, but it’s also the perfect venue to highlight your critical thoughts, show that you are really invested in this for the future, and may help get you in contact with fellow programmers. That also builds the community that I just talked about in number two.

4. **Introduce yourself to potential employers early on.**
This also comes back to community. Are you involved in the tech scene in your city? Start going to meetups. Talk to people in real life. Learn along with them. You may actually be introducing yourself to friends of potential employers and building those connections without even knowing it at first. Once you are close to finishing those 1,000 hours (or whatever you deem prepared to become a full stack developer), ask them out to coffee to get a feel of what type of employee they’re looking for. You may be surprised by the results.

5. **Boost your motivation with the bigger picture in mind.**
Why do you ultimately want to become a developer? There must be some larger project you’ve had in mind. Maybe it’s building a new app to connect people to a cause you care about, or perhaps you dream of being the CTO of your own company one day. Regardless of what that dream is, take incremental steps to work towards that goal so you can measure the ways in which you’re making real progress.

6. **Recognize how far you’ve made it**.
Becoming a software developer is not easy. Look back at the work you’ve done every couple of weeks and give yourself credit for knowing what you didn’t know before. Some progress is better than none, and some days will be more difficult than others. It doesn’t mean you’re  not making progress.

When it comes down to it, it's always about dedication and grit. If you really want to find a way to become a full stack developer, those hours will melt away — and you'll find a career you're truly passionate about. That's when the true work will begin. I wish you the best of luck in building that future for yourself!
